Defying common sense in a time when budget deficits are ballooning, the Council, in what some see as a stunt to polish its green credentials, has chosen to prioritize leaves over law enforcement. As crime statistics take a backseat, one wonders if future muggers will hide behind the council's expensive foliage."}).then((response) => {
